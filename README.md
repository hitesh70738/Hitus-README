# Hitus-README

## Task
Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Approach
I used the activites and help from the assistance for this task. Going over the activites and doing some extra google search helped with this task. I used external websites like stack-overflow, mdm, and chatgpt etc. These tools helped me develop the code I have so far.
